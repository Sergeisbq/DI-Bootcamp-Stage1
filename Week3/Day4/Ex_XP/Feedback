hi, in the exercise xp with the random sentence you get the error:

IndexError: list index out of range.

It looks like the error is being caused because the j value generated by the random.randint function is sometimes greater than the length of the text_lines list.

To fix this error, you can modify the make_sentence function to generate a
random index within the valid range of text_lines by subtracting 1
from the length of the list when using random.randint.

You just need to modify the line that generates the random
integer j to use len(text_lines) - 1 instead of just len(text_lines):

j = random.randint(1, len(text_lines) - 1)

hope this helps!
