        <h1>THOR ODINSON</h1>
        <h2>"Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as<br>
            the Asgardians, a group of humanoid beings from the pocket <br>
            dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal. Thor is the son of <br>
            Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was worshiped <br>
            by the humans known as Vikings and became part of Norse <br>
            Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir,<br>
            which helps him to channel his godly energies, he became <br>
            the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. When his irresponsible <br>
            and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard <br>
            (more commonly known as Earth) as a disabled mortal medical student <br>
            named Donald Blake, stripped of his memory. After learning humility <br>
            he regained his memory as well as his godly powers. Thor went on to <br>
            become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members <br>
            of the Avengers, "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".</h2>
